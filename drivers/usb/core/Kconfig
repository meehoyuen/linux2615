	  Say Y here if you want the USB core & hub drivers to produce a bunch
	  of debug messages to the system log. Select this if you are having a
	  problem with USB support and want to see more of what is going on.

	---help---
	  If you say Y here (and to "/proc file system support" in the "File
	  systems" section, above), you will get a file /proc/bus/usb/devices
	  which lists the devices currently connected to your USB bus or
	  busses, and for every connected device a file named
	  "/proc/bus/usb/xxx/yyy", where xxx is the bus number and yyy the
	  device number; the latter files can be used by user space programs
	  to talk directly to the device. These files are "virtual", meaning
	  they are generated on the fly and not stored on the hard drive.

	  You may need to mount the usbfs file system to see the files, use
	  mount -t usbfs none /proc/bus/usb

	  For the format of the various /proc/bus/usb/ files, please read
	  <file:Documentation/usb/proc_usb_info.txt>.

	  Please note that this code is completely unrelated to devfs, the
	  "/dev file system support".

	  Most users want to say Y here.
