config INPUT
	tristate "Generic input layer (needed for keyboard, mouse, ...)" if EMBEDDED
	default y
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you have any input device (mouse, keyboard, tablet,
	  joystick, steering wheel ...) connected to your system and want
	  it to be available to applications. This includes standard PS/2
	  keyboard and mouse.

	  Say N here if you have a headless (no monitor, no keyboard) system.

	  More information is available: <file:Documentation/input/input.txt>

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called input.

config INPUT_MOUSEDEV
	tristate "Mouse interface" if EMBEDDED
	default y
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want your mouse to be accessible as char devices
	  13:32+ - /dev/input/mouseX and 13:63 - /dev/input/mice as an
	  emulated IntelliMouse Explorer PS/2 mouse. That way, all user space
	  programs (including SVGAlib, GPM and X) will be able to use your
	  mouse.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called mousedev.

config INPUT_MOUSEDEV_PSAUX
	bool "Provide legacy /dev/psaux device"
	default y
	depends on INPUT_MOUSEDEV
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want your mouse also be accessible as char device
	  10:1 - /dev/psaux. The data available through /dev/psaux is exactly
	  the same as the data from /dev/input/mice.

	  If unsure, say Y.


config INPUT_MOUSEDEV_SCREEN_X
	int "Horizontal screen resolution"
	depends on INPUT_MOUSEDEV
	default "1024"
	help
	  If you're using a digitizer, or a graphic tablet, and want to use
	  it as a mouse then the mousedev driver needs to know the X window
	  screen resolution you are using to correctly scale the data. If
	  you're not using a digitizer, this value is ignored.

config INPUT_MOUSEDEV_SCREEN_Y
	int "Vertical screen resolution"
	depends on INPUT_MOUSEDEV
	default "768"
	help
	  If you're using a digitizer, or a graphic tablet, and want to use
	  it as a mouse then the mousedev driver needs to know the X window
	  screen resolution you are using to correctly scale the data. If
	  you're not using a digitizer, this value is ignored.

config INPUT_EVDEV
	tristate "Event interface"
	help
	  Say Y here if you want your input device events be accessible
	  under char device 13:64+ - /dev/input/eventX in a generic way.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called evdev.
