	bool "QoS and/or fair queueing"
	---help---
	  When the kernel has several packets to send out over a network
	  device, it has to decide which ones to send first, which ones to
	  delay, and which ones to drop. This is the job of the queueing
	  disciplines, several different algorithms for how to do this
	  "fairly" have been proposed.

	  If you say N here, you will get the standard packet scheduler, which
	  is a FIFO (first come, first served). If you say Y here, you will be
	  able to choose from among several alternative algorithms which can
	  then be attached to different network devices. This is useful for
	  example if some of your network devices are real time devices that
	  need a certain minimum data flow rate, or if you need to limit the
	  maximum data flow rate for traffic which matches specified criteria.
	  This code is considered to be experimental.

	  To administer these schedulers, you'll need the user-level utilities
	  from the package iproute2+tc at <ftp://ftp.tux.org/pub/net/ip-routing/>.
	  That package also contains some documentation; for more, check out
	  <http://linux-net.osdl.org/index.php/Iproute2>.

	  This Quality of Service (QoS) support will enable you to use
	  Differentiated Services (diffserv) and Resource Reservation Protocol
	  (RSVP) on your Linux router if you also say Y to the corresponding
	  classifiers below.  Documentation and software is at
	  <http://diffserv.sourceforge.net/>.

	  If you say Y here and to "/proc file system" below, you will be able
	  to read status information about packet schedulers from the file
	  /proc/net/psched.

	  The available schedulers are listed in the following questions; you
	  can say Y to as many as you like. If unsure, say N now.
